description: everything could be delicious.
---

Today's weather is pretty, sometimes it is sunny and sometimes it rains.

The sun still be here when it rains.

The high temperature at kuala lumpur makes me feel anxiety.

There are many ravens near the UMCCED, they are pure black and look fat.

Some of my classmates think think that these ravens must be delicious.

But the raven's call is very scrannel as I have ever heard.

August twenty 29th.

good day.

week2,day3.
